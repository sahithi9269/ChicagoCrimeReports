Chicago Crime Reports
Data Source: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2
Objective
This dataset includes reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders, for which data is 
available for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago between 2001 and the present, minus the 
most recent seven days. The information is derived from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen 
Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system. Addresses are shown at the block level only to protect 
the privacy of crime victims, and specific locations are not identified.
Data Description
1. ID - Unique identifier for the record. 
2. Case Number - The Chicago Police Department RD Number
3. Date - Date when the incident occurred. this is sometimes a best estimate.
4. Block - The partially redacted address where the incident occurred.
5. IUCR - The Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting code.
6. Primary Type - The primary description of the IUCR code.
7. Description - The secondary description of the IUCR code, a subcategory of the primary description.
8. Location Description - Description of the location where the incident occurred.
9. Arrest - Indicates whether an arrest was made.
10. Domestic - Indicates whether the incident was domestic-related as defined by the Illinois Domestic 
Violence Act.
11. Beat - Indicates the beat where the incident occurred.
12. District - Indicates the police district where the incident occurred.
13. Ward - The ward (City Council district) where the incident occurred.
14. Community Area - Indicates the community area where the incident occurred.
15. FBI Code - Indicates the crime classification as outlined in the FBI's National Incident-Based 
Reporting System (NIBRS).
16. X Coordinate - The x coordinate of the location where the incident occurred
17. Y Coordinate - The y coordinate of the location where the incident occurred
18. Year - Year the incident occurred.
19. Updated On - Date and time the record was last updated.
20. Latitude - The latitude of the location where the incident occurred
21. Longitude - The longitude of the location where the incident occurred. 
22. The location where the incident occurred in a format that allows for creation of maps and other 
geographic operations on this data portal. 
Exploratory Data Analysis
Using this data frame I have shown the basic visualizations. In have used different types of visualizations
where the data can be described in different ways. It shows the basic data exploration and many 
statements. And here while I was doing the visualizations I faced problems due to large number of 
categorical columns and values. While doing some plots it was showing the data as bulk and cannot get 
the proper visualizations. So, that in this case I need to take the value count to a limit from the columns 
that I need to visualize.
Modeling
I choose "Arrest" as my target variable for modeling. And I have created pipelines for modeling but we 
donâ€™t have any numerical features in the dataset so, we have only categorical variables we created 
categorical pipeline.
Model Selection
As we observe here "logistic regression model" performs well as it got 90% accuracy. So, I selected this 
as the best model for my data.
Summary
1. Logistic regression performs well among the decision tree model and KNN-model.
2. The roc accuracy score is higher for the logistic regression as it maintains 90.01% 
3. Comparing the F1 score among the models here also the logistic regression is best with 72.61%. But 
here in this case both logistic regression and KNN-Model are same with same score so, logistic 
regression is the best model for this data
4. Coming to the crimes most of the crimes are theft based, in 10th district the crimes are high and also 
most of the crimes occurred in 10th month i.e., October.
Results
Logistic Regression Classifier
1. Logistic Regression Score: 88.59%
2. ROC-Accuracy Score: 90.10%
3. F1-Score: 72.61%
Decision-Tree Classifier
1. Logistic Regression Score: 88.59%
2. ROC-Accuracy Score: 86.79%
3. F1-Score: 72.08%
KNN-Model 
1. Logistic Regression Score: 88.33%
2. ROC-Accuracy Score: 87.54%
3. F1-Score: 72.61%
Further Exploration and Features
1. I want to explore more visualizations in the final submission.
2. As after observing the data set while doing the visualizations I want to consider the "Description" 
columns as my target variable to get the code to be explored. 
3. Here I have no chance to use the column "Location Description" as we have lot of null values and no 
chance to get the perfect visualizations.
4. In the future project I am going to analyse the accuracy of the crimes using the Description as target 
variable, and going to use the particular classifiers and machine learning problem curve depending upon 
the data. 
5. I am going to split the data and create pipelines and also finding out the accuracy of test and train 
data sets.
6. On a note I just want to let you know that I could generate more visualizations and process the data 
ways while doing the final project.
7. A typical approach is, to improve a model to use more data. In this case, I have only taken the chunk 
data i.e., upto 100,000 but including whole can improve the overall score as taking the chunk lot of data 
got missed like number of years or months.
8. We could try various techniques, such as a complicated neural network, but this could lead to 
additional problems and is overkill.
9. For more exploration we can use ensemble models, by using this the scores may get improved.
